-   _" There's no cloud, it's just someone else's computer ! "_
-   Instead of creating your own server, using someone's else server to host your data through internet.
-   use concept of 'service oriented architecture'
-   There are **3 main types** of services:
    -   IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
    -   PaaS - Platform as a service
    -   SaaS - Software as a service
    -   More:
        -   BaaS - Backend as a service
        -   FaaS - Functions as a service
