## 1. What is Cloud computing

-   _" There's no cloud, it's just someone else's computer ! "_
-   Instead of creating your own server, using someone's else server to host your data through internet.
-   use concept of 'service oriented architecture'
-   There are **3 main types** of services:
    -   IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
    -   PaaS - Platform as a service
    -   SaaS - Software as a service
    -   More:
        -   BaaS - Backend as a service
        -   FaaS - Functions as a service
        -   Serverless
        -   etc.

### 1.1 Cloud service models:

#### IaaS

-   This provide infrastructures as a service.
-   infrastructures are virtual machine, Storage, cpu. gpu, memory, load balancing, network, disk, etc.
-   This is the base of cloud-computing.
-   users: IT admins

#### PaaS

-   This provide platform as a service.
-   Provide runtime & tool set that is required to run, develop, test our application.
-   Runs on top of infrastructure.
-   users: Software developers

#### SaaS

-   SaaS provides you a complete product that run/managed by service providers.
-   pay-as-you-go pricing model.
-   users: End customers

#### BaaS

-   No need to write backend from scratch. Just have to link our front-end to this service.
-   This will provide all backend services like, DB, purchasing, notifications, authentications, etc.
-   eg: Firebase

#### FaaS

-   When you need to store a functionality in cloud.
-   eg: when user uploads a document send a notification.

### 1.2 Cloud deployment models:

#### Public Cloud

-   These can be access publicly over the internet.
-   eg: AWS, Azure

#### Private Cloud

-   These can be access privately within an organization.
-   eg: AWS, VMware

#### Hybrid Cloud

-   Consists the functionality of both public & private.
-   eg: NASA use private cloud to store sensitive info & public cloud for others.

## 3. Cloud advantages vs disadvantages

### Advantages

-   **Low cost**
    -   On premises servers will cost more.
    -   No need to hire server admins.
-   **Unlimited resources**
    -   Have unlimited storage.
    -   pay-as-you-go method
-   **Pay for the use**
-   **Global level collaboration**
    -   Can login to servers from anywhere.
    -   Customer support.

### Disadvantages

-   Can be less customized.
-   Security issue: _depends_
-   Need good internet connection
